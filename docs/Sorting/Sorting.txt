sortFilters.exe is a command line program that will sort a txt file adhering to the standard ascii sort order, It also removed any un-needed empty lines.



usage:

sortFilters.exe file.txt

I use Notepad ++ as my default editor for txt file (PSPad seems to do weird thing with the context menu am I have not bothered loking to see what's up yet), you will find a sample registry file that will add a "sort filters" context menu for txt files located in the same folder (paths will need to be modifed to suit your needs).



Note:

Does not seem to like XP.
