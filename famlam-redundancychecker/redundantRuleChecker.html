    <h3>Redundancy check for Adblock Plus rules</h3>
    <p id="topmsg">This script checks if there are any redundant rules in your Adblock Plus filter list. A rule is redundant if the content it blocks, hides or excludes is also blocked, hidden or excluded by another rule.<br/>For example, <em>||somesite.com/ads/</em> has been made redundant by <em>/ads/*</em>. All calculations are performed on your computer, no data is send to the server.</p>
